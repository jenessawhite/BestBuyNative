This project was created by [me (Jenessa White)!](https://github.com/jenessawhite/) and is practice for creating a mobile app with react-native. The pages are a list of Best Buy products, and stores with their information and a Google Map showing where they are located. It also includes a homepage, navigation bar, and an about page as well.

## Sources

This project was bootstrapped with [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs). The API for this project was provided by [The Best Buy API Playground](https://github.com/bestbuy/api-playground), which is provided by Best Buy as a learning tool for developers. This app is an educational project and is not created or endorsed by Best Buy. This project also utilizes [React-Native-Navigation](https://github.com/wix/react-native-navigation/).
